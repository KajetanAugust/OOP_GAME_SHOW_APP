PHRASE HUNTER - GAME SHOW APP WITH OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

This is my submission for Unit 4 project.

PROJECT BASED ON VANILLA JAVASCRIPT AND OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

Phrase hunter is a browser game in which the player has to guess the known phrases.

When the player clicks the start button the game draws the random quote from the array 
and hides the letters under the tiles. The player has to guess the phrase choosing letters
on the onscreen keyboard or using physical keyboard. 
When the letter is guessed the letter from the phrase is uncovered, 
when the letter is not a match player looses one life.

The game ends if all the letters in the phrase are uncovered or if all lives are lost.
When the game ends appropriate screen is displayed and the player can play again by pressing the button.
